Description: Simple Pythonic remote deployment tool
 Fabric is designed to upload files and run shell commands on a number of
 servers in parallel or serially. These commands are grouped in tasks (which
 are regular Python functions) and specified in a 'fabfile.'
 .
 It is similar to Capistrano, except it's implemented in Python and doesn't
 expect you to be deploying Rails applications.
